My budget story actually begins with wealth! For as long as I can remember, all I wanted to do was 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">work. I loved the sense of accomplishment it gave me and the joy involved with building up my bank&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">account and savings. By the time I turned 18, I was a supervisor of a successful framing crew, working&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">on average 55 hours a week. I bought a brand-new truck and had it paid off in a year. I fell under the&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">category of what you would term, "sitting pretty".</span>

Well, as the old adage goes, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes debt? In our first few 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">years of marriage, we made some poor financial decisions and very quickly ended up living paycheck to&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">paycheck. I can remember one particular time when the mortgage was due and I had to work 62 hours&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">that week just to pay it – with no money left over afterwards. The financial strain became too heavy,&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and soon we found ourselves taking the frustration out on each other. It definitely wasn't the 'Happily&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ever After' I had imagined for myself.</span>

Then one day, I just knew it had to stop; the overdraft notices in the mail, the constant feeling of going 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">backwards in life, and the misery I saw on my wife's face - it all had to stop. We were more than&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">$350,000 in debt when I finally said, "Enough is enough". I knew the key to crawling out of our debt&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">hole was to stop spending more than I was making. Seems like that should be common knowledge,&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">right? You would be surprised! According to data I read recently in (include where you go the&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">information), 50% of American families spend more in month than they bring home. I can’t imagine all&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of those people feeling as low as I had felt! Anyone who is ready for a change can follow the same&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">system that helped me all those years ago.</span>

My first step was to create a budget. Please note that I did not say, I WANTED to create a budget, but 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">rather that I HAD to create a budget. Over the years, you would not believe how many bubbles I have&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">burst by telling people that in order to control their money, they have to control themselves, aka create&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">and stay true to a budget. This is a huge step in financial freedom, and one I will spend quite a bit on in&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the future. Part of creating our budget was to track our monthly expenses. I soon learned that you&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">cannot even begin to manage money until you know how much you’re spending and where you are&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">spending it. This involved tracking all our bills and expenditures and carefully recording where our&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">dollars went. It took several months to get on track with our budget and we failed many times. I&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">quickly realized that even when we failed, we were spending less than we did before we put ourselves&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">on a budget. It takes at least 90 days to even get close to making a budget work correctly. You forget&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">certain expenses and you always try to squeeze too much out of a dollar.</span>

In the beginning of our budgeting days, we fell down and got a lot of bruises. A budget is like riding a 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">bike -- it takes practice. The more you ride the bike the easier it becomes. The longer you live on a&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">budget the easier it will be to maintain. So many people feel a budget is “too restricting.” They fear&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">they will have to survive on “bread and water” and give up “having fun” in life. But that is not true at all.</span>

A budget is just a plan. It simply puts you in control of your money, rather than having your money 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">control you. People assume that it takes the excitement out of life, but in essence, it does the opposite&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">by eliminating stress and conflict and allowing spending to be enjoyed guilt-free. You can create a&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">budget that allows you to eat filet mignon every day as long as you plan for it!</span>

My wife and I have been working from a budget for six years now. It only takes me about 10 minutes a 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">month to get our budget set. I can practically do it blindfolded. I've read multiple books and paid for a&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">variety of software and apps to get our budget under control. If you will join me on my journey, I will&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">share my mistakes with you so you don't have to make the same ones. I'll also let you in on the secrets&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">of which software and apps are worth your money.</span>

There is so much freedom in being in control of your money. Once you get the hang of it, you won't have 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">to stress about money ever again. In just a few years of making the decision to actively organize and&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">manage our finances, my wife and I are down to the last of our debt, which is around $4,000, plus our&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">mortgage. But the relief from daily stress, the sense of empowerment, and the strong teamwork in our&nbsp;</span>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">family are worth even more.</span>
