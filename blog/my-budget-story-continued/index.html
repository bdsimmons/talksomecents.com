    <div id="content">
        <p>My family and I had to make many sacrifices as we worked to get out of debt.  The first thing we had to do was to “stop the bleeding.” We cut up all credits cards and refused to create new debt.   We had also gotten into a habit of “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”  For example, we would borrow money from my brother in order to pay off credit cards, but within 12 months, the card would be at maximum again.  No one can borrow their way out of debt.  There needed to be a definite plan.  No matter how much money we made, without a plan, we would continue to live paycheck to paycheck, indefinitely.   We were spending more than our income in pursuit of what we thought was the American Dream.  Soon, we realized that you can put yourself into debt overnight, but it takes years to get out of it. Without a budget, we would never be in control of our money and we would continue to spend more than we made.   A little time and effort went a long way towards putting us in control and eliminating stress from our lives and marriage.</p>

<p>To create our budget, we began by estimating and then tracking and confirming costs.  These included things like bills, utilities, groceries, eating out and any other extra costs (such as birthdays, potential vacations, holidays, etc.)  We also wrote down all of our debts, listing them from smallest to largest to get an idea of what needed to be tackled.  We started by deciding to pay towards the smallest debt first, so that we would gain a simpler “win” and feel empowered to continue the journey.  After that, we began each month by figuring out how much money we would have for the entire month.  We subtracted all of the before-mentioned costs.  The goal is for the mathematics of this to add up to a big, fat zero.   It most certainly did not do so in the beginning.   Modifications to the budget were made as we became more conscientious of our spending and as we began tracking income and expenditures more carefully.   The most important principle in budgeting is to give every dollar a “job.”  Make sure every dollar has a place to go, and pair your income with your budget in order to know exactly where it is going.</p>

<p>One very important part of budgeting is saving.  Always remember to pay yourself first.  We knew that if we ever wanted to achieve financial freedom, we had to make sure that we put money into our savings account first.   So many times, people say, “If I make more money, then I’ll save.”  Or, “I can’t afford to save!”  In reality, it’s about saying (over and over again): you can’t afford NOT to save.  When a person decides to run a marathon, they do not begin with the entire race.  They begin with training in small amounts and distances.  In budgeting and working towards being debt free, you must begin with baby steps.  You must train yourself to build the self control involved with saving.  A small start is all that is needed.  We began with a very small amount and built it up over time, as the debt decreased and we had more flexibility.  By the time finances allowed for larger amounts to be set aside, we had already created and maintained the habit and were able to benefit from it.</p>

<p>After all these principles were mapped out and initiated, we then began looking at ways in which the budget would allow for extra money to be applied towards our debt, beyond the minimum payments.  As part of this step, we changed some things about our lives.  We moved out of our home and into a 400-square foot trailer to reduce daily living costs.  We began to plan out our meals to reduce grocery expenses.  We did many other things to help financially that will be the subject of another blog post, but the key point is that our budget and some lifestyle changes made it possible to start immediately on the ultimate goal of eliminating debt.</p>
