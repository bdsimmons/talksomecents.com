      <title>My Budget Story Continues: You Will Always Fail at Money Without a Plan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It isn’t how much money you make that matters but rather the plan that you make with that money. My family and I have used many different products to budget.  We have done a budget on paper. We have used phone applications.  We have used websites.   The only criterion for choosing the best tool for your budget is to ensure that it works for you and your family and that you will use it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the number one goal in budgeting is to make sure every dollar has a job to do, an effective tool is one that allows you to see everything in action in order to achieve the equation, “Income – Expense =$0.” Otherwise, you are doing the budget incorrectly.   If using a pencil and paper makes this achievable for you, or if you work best with a fancier Excel spreadsheet, or even if you want to find a software program or phone app, it really does not matter.   Just ensure that you are working on your budget in some manner at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future blogs, I will review several of the most popular budgeting tools that are available and evaluate their effectiveness and ease of use.   But in this segment of my own personal budget story, I will just state that my favorite out of all of these options is the program, You Need a Budget (YNAB).  I call it my glorified checking account. It is very easy to use. The thing I like about it is that it keeps you very organized and you cannot overspend if you are implementing the strategy correctly.  YNAB consists of various categories, both income and expenditure related, and is accessible on both a computer and individual smart phones.   Once you enter the values into each budget category, you can see at a glance exactly where your money is and where it needs to go.  By updating the budget regularly (even immediately after a purchase, when using the smart phone app), it is possible to know the exact amount that remains in each category.    For example, instead of thinking that you have $5,000 in your checking account and spending without foresight, by using YNAB, you can look at your categories on the computer or phone and realize that there is only $200 in the Eating Out category, or $450 in the Groceries category.  This allows you to spend within your budget, limits overspending, and keeps you in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within six to nine months of following the YNAB budget, I was a month ahead on my bills.  This was amazing, considering that during the first eight years of my marriage, I had been living paycheck to paycheck.  YNAB helped me to form significant money habits that I continue to this day.  Each month, I spend 10 minutes with my budget, accessing the YNAB app and creating categories and expenses for next four weeks.   In the beginning, I failed miserable at this. I overspent and I forgot categories. But the one thing that kept me going was the knowledge that if I was overspending WITH a budget, I would have been spending twice that amount WITHOUT one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Budget Story Continued</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My family and I had to make many sacrifices as we worked to get out of debt.  The first thing we had to do was to “stop the bleeding.” We cut up all credits cards and refused to create new debt.   We had also gotten into a habit of “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”  For example, we would borrow money from my brother in order to pay off credit cards, but within 12 months, the card would be at maximum again.  No one can borrow their way out of debt.  There needed to be a definite plan.  No matter how much money we made, without a plan, we would continue to live paycheck to paycheck, indefinitely.   We were spending more than our income in pursuit of what we thought was the American Dream.  Soon, we realized that you can put yourself into debt overnight, but it takes years to get out of it. Without a budget, we would never be in control of our money and we would continue to spend more than we made.   A little time and effort went a long way towards putting us in control and eliminating stress from our lives and marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create our budget, we began by estimating and then tracking and confirming costs.  These included things like bills, utilities, groceries, eating out and any other extra costs (such as birthdays, potential vacations, holidays, etc.)  We also wrote down all of our debts, listing them from smallest to largest to get an idea of what needed to be tackled.  We started by deciding to pay towards the smallest debt first, so that we would gain a simpler “win” and feel empowered to continue the journey.  After that, we began each month by figuring out how much money we would have for the entire month.  We subtracted all of the before-mentioned costs.  The goal is for the mathematics of this to add up to a big, fat zero.   It most certainly did not do so in the beginning.   Modifications to the budget were made as we became more conscientious of our spending and as we began tracking income and expenditures more carefully.   The most important principle in budgeting is to give every dollar a “job.”  Make sure every dollar has a place to go, and pair your income with your budget in order to know exactly where it is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very important part of budgeting is saving.  Always remember to pay yourself first.  We knew that if we ever wanted to achieve financial freedom, we had to make sure that we put money into our savings account first.   So many times, people say, “If I make more money, then I’ll save.”  Or, “I can’t afford to save!”  In reality, it’s about saying (over and over again): you can’t afford NOT to save.  When a person decides to run a marathon, they do not begin with the entire race.  They begin with training in small amounts and distances.  In budgeting and working towards being debt free, you must begin with baby steps.  You must train yourself to build the self control involved with saving.  A small start is all that is needed.  We began with a very small amount and built it up over time, as the debt decreased and we had more flexibility.  By the time finances allowed for larger amounts to be set aside, we had already created and maintained the habit and were able to benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these principles were mapped out and initiated, we then began looking at ways in which the budget would allow for extra money to be applied towards our debt, beyond the minimum payments.  As part of this step, we changed some things about our lives.  We moved out of our home and into a 400-square foot trailer to reduce daily living costs.  We began to plan out our meals to reduce grocery expenses.  We did many other things to help financially that will be the subject of another blog post, but the key point is that our budget and some lifestyle changes made it possible to start immediately on the ultimate goal of eliminating debt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Budget Story: It&#39;s not what you make; it’s how much you spend.</title>
      <link>http://talksomecents.com/blog/my-budget-story/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My budget story actually begins with wealth!  For as long as I can remember, all I wanted to do was work.  I loved the sense of accomplishment it gave me and the joy involved with building up my bank account and savings.  By the time I turned 18, I was a supervisor of a successful framing crew, working on average 55 hours a week.  I bought a brand-new truck and had it paid off in a year.  I fell under the category of what you would term, &amp;ldquo;sitting pretty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as the old adage goes, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes debt?  In our first few years of marriage, we made some poor financial decisions and very quickly ended up living paycheck to paycheck. I can remember one particular time when the mortgage was due and I had to work 62 hours that week just to pay it – with no money left over afterwards. The financial strain became too heavy, and soon we found ourselves taking the frustration out on each other.  It definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;lsquo;Happily Ever After&amp;rsquo; I had imagined for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, I just knew it had to stop; the overdraft notices in the mail, the constant feeling of going backwards in life, and the misery I saw on my wife&amp;rsquo;s face - it all had to stop.  We were more than $350,000 in debt when I finally said, &amp;ldquo;Enough is enough.&amp;rdquo;  I knew the key to crawling out of our debt hole was to stop spending more than I was making.  Seems like that should be common knowledge, right?  You would be surprised!   According to data I read recently in (Forbes.com), 52% of Americans continue to spend more than they make. In fact, for every dollar that the average American earns, he or she spends $1.33! I can’t imagine all of those people feeling as low as I had felt!   Anyone who is ready for a change can follow the same system that helped me all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was to create a budget.  Please note that I did not say, I WANTED to create a budget, but rather that I HAD to create a budget.  Over the years, you would not believe how many bubbles I have burst by telling people that in order to control their money, they have to control themselves, aka create and stay true to a budget.  This is a huge step in financial freedom, and one I will spend quite a bit on in the future.    Part of creating our budget was to track our monthly expenses.  I soon learned that you cannot even begin to manage money until you know how much you’re spending and where you are spending it.   This involved tracking all our bills and expenditures and carefully recording where our dollars went.    It took several months to get on track with our budget and we failed many times.  I quickly realized that even when we failed, we were spending less than we did before we put ourselves on a budget.  It takes at least 90 days to even get close to making a budget work correctly.  You forget certain expenses and you always try to squeeze too much out of a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of our budgeting days, we fell down and got a lot of bruises. A budget is like riding a bike &amp;ndash; it takes practice. The more you ride the bike the easier it becomes. The longer you live on a budget the easier it will be to maintain.  So many people feel a budget is “too restricting.”  They fear they will have to survive on “bread and water” and give up “having fun” in life.  But that is not true at all.  A budget is just a plan.  It simply puts you in control of your money, rather than having your money control you.  People assume that it takes the excitement out of life, but in essence, it does the opposite by eliminating stress and conflict and allowing spending to be enjoyed guilt-free. You can create a budget that allows you to eat filet mignon every day as long as you plan for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been working from a budget for six years now. It only takes me about 10 minutes a month to get our budget set.  I can practically do it blindfolded.  I&amp;rsquo;ve read multiple books and paid for a variety of software and apps to get our budget under control. If you will join me on my journey, I will share my mistakes with you so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make the same ones. I&amp;rsquo;ll also let you in on the secrets of which software and apps are worth your money.
There is so much freedom in being in control of your money. Once you get the hang of it, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to stress about money ever again.   In just a few years of making the decision to actively organize and manage our finances, my wife and I are down to the last of our debt, which is around $4,000, plus our mortgage.  But the relief from daily stress, the sense of empowerment, and the strong teamwork in our family are worth even more.&lt;/p&gt;
