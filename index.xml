      <title>My Budget Story: It&#39;s not what you make; it’s how much you spend.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My budget story actually begins with wealth! For as long as I can remember, all I wanted to do was work. I loved the sense of accomplishment it gave me and the joy involved with building up my bank account and savings. By the time I turned 18, I was a supervisor of a successful framing crew, working on average 55 hours a week. I bought a brand-new truck and had it paid off in a year. I fell under the category of what you would term, &amp;ldquo;sitting pretty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as the old adage goes, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes debt? In our first few 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;years of marriage, we made some poor financial decisions and very quickly ended up living paycheck to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;paycheck. I can remember one particular time when the mortgage was due and I had to work 62 hours&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;that week just to pay it – with no money left over afterwards. The financial strain became too heavy,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;and soon we found ourselves taking the frustration out on each other. It definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;lsquo;Happily&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;Ever After&amp;rsquo; I had imagined for myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, I just knew it had to stop; the overdraft notices in the mail, the constant feeling of going 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;backwards in life, and the misery I saw on my wife&amp;rsquo;s face - it all had to stop. We were more than&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;$350,000 in debt when I finally said, &amp;ldquo;Enough is enough&amp;rdquo;. I knew the key to crawling out of our debt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;hole was to stop spending more than I was making. Seems like that should be common knowledge,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;right? You would be surprised! According to data I read recently in (include where you go the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;information), 50% of American families spend more in month than they bring home. I can’t imagine all&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;of those people feeling as low as I had felt! Anyone who is ready for a change can follow the same&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;system that helped me all those years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was to create a budget. Please note that I did not say, I WANTED to create a budget, but 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;rather that I HAD to create a budget. Over the years, you would not believe how many bubbles I have&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;burst by telling people that in order to control their money, they have to control themselves, aka create&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;and stay true to a budget. This is a huge step in financial freedom, and one I will spend quite a bit on in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;the future. Part of creating our budget was to track our monthly expenses. I soon learned that you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;cannot even begin to manage money until you know how much you’re spending and where you are&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;spending it. This involved tracking all our bills and expenditures and carefully recording where our&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;dollars went. It took several months to get on track with our budget and we failed many times. I&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;quickly realized that even when we failed, we were spending less than we did before we put ourselves&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;on a budget. It takes at least 90 days to even get close to making a budget work correctly. You forget&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;certain expenses and you always try to squeeze too much out of a dollar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of our budgeting days, we fell down and got a lot of bruises. A budget is like riding a 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;bike &amp;ndash; it takes practice. The more you ride the bike the easier it becomes. The longer you live on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;budget the easier it will be to maintain. So many people feel a budget is “too restricting.” They fear&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;they will have to survive on “bread and water” and give up “having fun” in life. But that is not true at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A budget is just a plan. It simply puts you in control of your money, rather than having your money 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;control you. People assume that it takes the excitement out of life, but in essence, it does the opposite&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;by eliminating stress and conflict and allowing spending to be enjoyed guilt-free. You can create a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;budget that allows you to eat filet mignon every day as long as you plan for it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been working from a budget for six years now. It only takes me about 10 minutes a 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;month to get our budget set. I can practically do it blindfolded. I&amp;rsquo;ve read multiple books and paid for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;variety of software and apps to get our budget under control. If you will join me on my journey, I will&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;share my mistakes with you so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make the same ones. I&amp;rsquo;ll also let you in on the secrets&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;of which software and apps are worth your money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much freedom in being in control of your money. Once you get the hang of it, you won&amp;rsquo;t have 
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;to stress about money ever again. In just a few years of making the decision to actively organize and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;manage our finances, my wife and I are down to the last of our debt, which is around $4,000, plus our&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;mortgage. But the relief from daily stress, the sense of empowerment, and the strong teamwork in our&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;family are worth even more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
